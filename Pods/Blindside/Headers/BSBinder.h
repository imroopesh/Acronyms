/**
 * The BSBinder interface is used in configuration of Blindside. Using BSBinder,
 * you tell Blindside how to resolve dependencies.
 *
 * BSModules are passed a BSBinder during Blindside configuration. Your module will
 * invoke one or more bind: methods to describe how object dependencies should be
 * resolved. Here's an example of a configure: method on a simple BSModule,
 * adding one binding.
 *
 * \code
 * @implementation MyModule
 *
 * - (void)configure:(id<BSBinder>) binder {
 *
 *    NSString *endpoint = @"http://productionapi.example.com/";
 *    MyApi *api = [[MyApi alloc] initWithEndpoint:endpoint token:@"djhie7d3jvgnaluFH987dk"];
 *
 *    // binds the key [MyApi class] to the instance of MyApi we just created.
 *    // Any injected objects that need a MyApi will have this one given to them
 *    // by Blindside.
 *
 *    [binder bind:[MyApi class] toInstance:api];
 * }
 *
 * @end
 * \endcode
 *
 * All of the bind: methods take an id key as the first parameter. While the key can be any id,
 * they will commonly be strings, classes, or protocol identifiers. A class my be used as a key
 * when you want to bind to a specific instance/subclass. A protocol identifier can be used
 * to bind to a specific object or class implementing the protocol.
 *
 * When an injector is asked to retrieve an object, it examines the object's dependencies and
 * then looks at the bindings defined as above to figure out how to fill the
 * dependencies. This happens recursively, so the if one object depends on two more objects
 * that also have dependencies, everything is resolved by the injector.
 *
